┗Cargo.toml
```

### `src`

`src/` is just the folder that holds all your source files.

### `src/main.rs`

This is the main file that `cargo` will use for `cargo build` and `cargo run`. It should be relatively small, and only contain the code that you absolutely need for running the program.

### `Cargo.toml`

This is the file that `cargo` uses for dependency management, `crates.io` metadata, and just general information about your project.
