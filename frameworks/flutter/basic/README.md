### `test/`

This is where all the tests for your project go

### `ios/`

This is where some code that flutter uses lives. This isn't commonly edited by the developer because flutter manages it.

### `android/`

Same thing as the ios folder from above but for android.

### `lib/`

This is where all the code for our project lives.
