# ü¶ï [Deno](https://deno.land)

Deno has no required package structure, but the following structure is used by Deno's standard library and is recommended in the Deno manual.

## Basic

[Minimal Application Template](basic/)

```
‚îè‚îÅmod.ts
‚îÉ
‚îó‚îÅdeps.ts
```

### `mod.ts`

This file is the entrypoint to your package. Here, you can import classes and functions from other files, or you can write the program entirely in `mod.ts`.

#### Examples

```ts
export * from 'addition.ts';
export * from 'subtraction.ts';
```

\- or -

```ts
export function add(one: number, two: number) {
  return one + two;
}
```

### `deps.ts`

You can optionally save your external dependencies in a `deps.ts` file.

#### Example

```ts
export * from 'https://deno.land/std/http/mod.ts';
export * from 'https://deno.land/x/oak/mod.ts';
```

Then, import your dependencies elsewhere:

```ts
import { serve, Application } from './deps.ts';
```
